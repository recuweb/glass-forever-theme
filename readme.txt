Glass Forever WordPress Theme

- - DESCRIPTION - -

This theme is aimed at web pros, but is of course available and supported for anyone.

The bare essentials of a WordPress theme, no visual CSS styles added except for the CSS reset and the mandatory WP classes. Perfect for those who would like to build their own theme completely from scratch.

One custom menu and one widgetized sidebar to get you started.

If you'd like a jumpstart with a CSS framework and more custom menus, page templates and widgetized areas, checkout SuperSimple:
